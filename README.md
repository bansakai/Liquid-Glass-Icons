# Liquid Glass Icons
**A curated collection of handcrafted icons designed in Apple’s Icon Composer for macOS 26.**

Many legacy apps haven’t been updated to match macOS 26’s new design language, leaving the Dock and Finder looking inconsistent and dated. I’m taking it upon myself to redesign these icons from scratch to bring visual harmony back to the macOS experience.
